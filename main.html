          <p>
            Skilled manager with 4+ years with experience working in different teams. I did a lot of work on
            warehouses and online-shops. Now I am studying at the frontend developer courses. I want to get into a company with a friendly team to improve my knowledge and experience and acquire the skills necessary for a developer. In my free time I play musical instruments and read modern prose.
